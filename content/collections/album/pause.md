        text: "For ordinary guys, Joey Ryan & the Inks have a habit of\_making extraordinary music. Over the past five years, Joey\_Ryan, brothers Matt and Chris Mitchell, Ryan Mach, and\_Tim Dickson have solidified their place on local airwaves\_and stages and as the go-to band for catchy pop tunes with\_60s sunshine beats, with slivers of doo-wop on top of smart\_instrumental progression, topped by Ryan’s crystal-clear,\_bittersweet vocals."

        text: "Getting there has taken a lot of workingman’s ingenuity\_– recording around work schedules, setting up a studio in\_Ryan’s basement, and relying on the support and patience\_of friends and girlfriends. The music with a mutual respect\_and collaboration between the bandmates, and the pleasure\_of playing has paid off for the Inks. The two full length\_records under their belt have been popular and critically\_acclaimed; 2009’s Well, Here We Are Then as a Top 10 Local\_Release in both the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Minneapolis\_Star Tribune and 2011’s Dennis Lane recognized by the St.\_Paul Pioneer Press as the #1 Minnesota release of the year."

        text: "Out of the frenzy of hard work, shows and creativity, the\_third release from Joey Ryan & the Inks rises above. A six-\_song EP titled [pause.], due in May 2013, takes its title’s\_advice and gives the work of the past years the space to\_breathe, grow and move on. More layered, psychedelic and\_narrative, the characters and imagery of [pause.] come along\_with a transformative confidence, populated with egos and\_love affairs that are at once recognizable and universal."

        text: "Over it’s six songs, [pause.] packs in the excitement. Sweet-ness gets a turn in the lead single “Of A Feather” while “A\_Pompous Chorus Line” skews between light and dark and\_“The Transfiguration of Mr. Wolf” charts challenge and\_transformation. The more shimmering indie-pop “A Lonely\_Spark” recalls the best of Ben Gibbard, “Loose Ends” offers\_up mutual dissolution with a twist and album closer “For A\_Minute” takes a slow gospel survey of trying to fit in, turn-\_ing into a joyful invitation to enjoy the moment as it lasts."

        text: "[pause.] does that at its heart, takes the time to realize that\_meaning is made through music, through the performance\_and creativity there is joy and the regularity of life falls away.\_If Joey Ryan & the Inks are the ordinary guys their laidback\_demeanor makes them out to be, their music makes them\_extraordinary. [pause.] celebrates the look forward, and\_takes us along for the ride."
