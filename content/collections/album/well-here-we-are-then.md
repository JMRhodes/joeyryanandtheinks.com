        text: " is Joey Ryan & The Inks’ debut album released in December of 2009. Ryan had the bulk of these 12\_songs written and recorded\_in demo form & began forming the band in late 2008.\_ Coming from a variety of previous and current projects\_(The Exchange, The Alarmists, Flin Flon Bombers, Consolation Champ, Shanghai Subway)\_these\_‘Inks’ helped add\_the missing\_razor sharp instrumentation & polish that helped catapult the band onto the Twin Cities indie pop scene. The\_album topped many\_year end lists and helped land the band as a finalist in Vita.mn’s best new band competition."
